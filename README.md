# MIMO_Matlab
Converts MIMO acoustical measurements to their Impulse Responses. In development: calculate acoustical parameters.
This is specific to our particular pairing between sound source and microphone, and to the sine sweep employed.
Basic operation instructions: select the path containing your measurements when prompted, the results will be put in an 'output' subfolder.
